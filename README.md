Welcome to the Delish-n-Wholesome project! I’m absolutely thrilled to show you this exciting journey where Python meets real-world data management!

Here’s a glimpse of what Delish-n-Wholesome can do:

1. Seamless Google Sheets Integration
I’ve developed a Python application that connects seamlessly with Google Sheets through its API. This integration allows our program to effortlessly push and pull data, keeping everything synchronised and up-to-date.

2. Dynamic Stock Management
Enter a 6-digit code into our sleek Python frontend, and watch as the backend springs into action, instantly updating the stock data in Google Sheets.

3. Smart Surplus Calculation
Our program calculates the daily surplus and automatically updates the surplus page in the Google Spreadsheet. This feature helps the company better predict future stock needs, minimize waste, and make data-driven decisions.

4. Real-Time Sales Data
Here’s how the sales data is handled:

When a sale is entered, it’s reflected instantly in the spreadsheet, providing real-time updates on sales performance.

5. Stock Updates
The stock data is automatically updated in the Google Sheet whenever new data is entered. This ensures that stock levels are always accurate and up-to-date.

6. Heroku Deployment
I’ve deployed the project on Heroku, making it accessible online. You can see the project in action here: https://delish-n-wholesome-8ce733264d94.herokuapp.com/ This deployment ensures the Python app runs smoothly and updates the Google Sheet in real-time.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and check out the source code links provided with project and experience how Python and Google Sheets can come together to streamline data management and automate processes.
